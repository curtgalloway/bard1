BARD SONGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. FALKENTYNE'S FURY     This tune increases the damage your party 
                         will do in combat, by driving them into a 
                         berserker rage.

2. THE SEEKER'S BALLAD   This song will produce light when exploring, 
                         and during combat it will increase the 
                         party's chance of hitting a foe with a weapon.

3. WAYLAND'S WATCH       This song will soothe your savage foes, 
                         making them do less damage in combat.

4. BADH'R KILNFEST       This is an ancient Elven melody, which will 
                         heal the Bard's wounds during traveling, and 
                         heal the party's wounds during combat.

5. THE TRAVELLER'S TUNE  This melody makes the members of your party 
                         more dexterous and agile, and thus more 
                         difficult to hit.

6. LUCKLARAN             This song sets up a partial "anti-magic" 
                         field, which gives party members some 
                         increased protection against spell casting.
